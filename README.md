## Usage

```go
import (
	"github.com/auth0/go-auth0"
	"github.com/auth0/go-auth0/management"
)
```

Initialize a new client using a domain, client ID and secret.

```go
m, err := management.New(domain, management.WithClientCredentials(id, secret))
if err != nil {
	// handle err
}
```

With the management client we can now interact with the Auth0 Management API.

```go
c := &management.Client{
	Name:        auth0.String("Client Name"),
	Description: auth0.String("Long description of client"),
}

err = m.Client.Create(c)
if err != nil {
	// handle err
}

fmt.Printf("Created client %s\n", c.ClientID)
```

## Testing

To run the tests use the `make test` command. This will make use of pre-recorded http interactions found in the
[recordings](./management/testdata/recordings) folder. To add new recordings run the tests against an Auth0 tenant
individually using the following env var `AUTH0_HTTP_RECORDINGS=on`.

To run the tests against an Auth0 tenant, use the `make test-e2e` command. Start by creating an
[M2M app](https://auth0.com/docs/applications/set-up-an-application/register-machine-to-machine-applications) in the
tenant, that has been authorized to call the Management API and has all the required permissions.

Then create a local `.env` file in the `management` folder with the following settings:

* `AUTH0_DOMAIN`: The **Domain** of the M2M app
* `AUTH0_CLIENT_ID`: The **Client ID** of the M2M app
* `AUTH0_CLIENT_SECRET`: The **Client Secret** of the M2M app
* `AUTH0_DEBUG`: Set to `true` to call the Management API in debug mode, which dumps the HTTP requests and responses to the output

## What is Auth0?

Auth0 helps you to:

- Add authentication with [multiple authentication sources](https://auth0.com/docs/authenticate/identity-providers), either social like **Google, Facebook, Microsoft Account, LinkedIn, GitHub, Twitter, Box, Salesforce, amont others**, or enterprise identity systems like **Windows Azure AD, Google Apps, Active Directory, ADFS or any SAML Identity Provider**.
- Add authentication through more traditional **[username/password databases](https://auth0.com/docs/authenticate/database-connections/custom-db)**.
- Add support for **[linking different user accounts](https://auth0.com/docs/manage-users/user-accounts/user-account-linking)** with the same user.
- Support for generating signed [Json Web Tokens](https://auth0.com/docs/secure/tokens/json-web-tokens) to call your APIs and **flow the user identity** securely.
- Analytics of how, when and where users are logging in.
- Pull data from other sources and add it to the user profile, through [JavaScript rules](https://auth0.com/docs/customize/rules).
